The Odin Project "Landing Page" Project for CSS Flexbox

# Sample image from the course, visit the website to see my version.
<img src="./images/01.png" alt="sample image" />

Made this without checking anyone else's code. This was my first time completing a landing page project with little to no guidance. Not exactly sure if everything is good or "standard," but I think I did pretty good overall. Everything fits similar to the sample image.

Since there is nobody grading this, I would appreciate some feedback on what I could have done better.

Thanks!
